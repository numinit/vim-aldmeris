# veloth.vim

Veloth is a vim colorscheme based off of
[veloce/vim-aldmeris](https://github.com/veloce/vim-aldmeris).

Features:

* tango colors palette
* support 256 colors for terminal emulators
* option to use terminal base colors in the colorscheme: by setting term colors
with a tango palette, the result is very close to the gui version
* support terminal transparency
* tpope's fugitive integration: well recognizable colors for the output of
:Gstatus, and for git objects.

## Installation

Downloard veloth.vim and install in ~/.vim/colors. You can also use
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/numinit/vim-veloth.git

Try it out with

    :colorscheme veloth

If you want to make it the default, add that command to your vimrc or gvimrc.

If your terminal uses the tango palette as system colors, please add this to
your vimrc to obtain best results:

    let g:veloth_termcolors = "tango"

Here is the tango palette to put in a `.Xresources` file:

    ! Black
    *color0:  #2E3436
    *color8:  #555753
    ! Red
    *color1:  #CC0000
